## Design

### Design Choices
Quizzle was designed to be proud and loud about the country Scotland. With the consistent theme of the Scotland flags, colours and references to haggis, this is supposed to leave the user feeling positive about Scotland.

### Colour
The colour palette of the website was chose to match the colours of the Saltire (the Scottish flag). A black colour was used on the Contact Us page so as to improve contrast and make it easier to read.

### Fonts
Arial has been chosen as the main font throughout the website so as to reduce the chances of it not functioning properly on a browser while still presenting nicely. Helvetica and sans-serif are used as back up in case Arial fails.

### Structure
The website is structured in an easy-on-the-eye way with a simple layout that is easy for the user to navigate through. The user shall find 4 different pages within the website:

- A homepage with features to navigate to different areas:
    - To the game page.
    - To the Leaderboard.
    - To the Contact-us page.
    - To the social media pages
- The game page.
- The results page.
- The leaderboard page.
- The Contact Us page.
